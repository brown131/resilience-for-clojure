# resilience for clojure

A wrapper over the great library [Resilience4j](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) to provide fault tolerance to your service. Picked a lot of ideas from another great library [diehard](https://github.com/sunng87/diehard).

Please note that `Resilience4j` is still under heavy constructing. Maybe you need to be cautious of using it for your serious services.
